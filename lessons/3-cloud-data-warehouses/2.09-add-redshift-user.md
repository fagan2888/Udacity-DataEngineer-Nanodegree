1.  Save your credentials! This is the only time you can view or download these credentials on AWS. Choose Download .csv to download these credentials and then save this file to a safe location. You'll need to copy and paste this Access key ID and Secret access key in the next step.

We strongly advise you to keep this Access key ID and Secret access key closely guarded, including not putting them in a GitHub public repo, etc.

As of June 2020, the AWS Management Console's UI has slightly changed. You can find the updated documentation on IAM roles [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html).
