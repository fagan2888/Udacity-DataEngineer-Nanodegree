### Important Note

We believe that the amount of AWS Educate promotional credits we have arranged for Udacity students to receive for free from AWS is sufficient to allow you to complete all of your work in the Data Engineering ND, *if you follow the guidelines we provide in this lesson for using your credits wisely*.

#### Key recommendations for using your AWS credits wisely:

-   Delete your Amazon Redshift cluster each time you're finished working.
-   Use a smaller subset of your data while you code and debug on AWS, and only execute with the full dataset on AWS as a final test of your code.

If you exceed the AWS credits that you are provided, you will be responsible for purchasing any additional credits necessary to complete the Nanodegree. Students are solely responsible for monitoring usage charges on the AWS account you use.

If you believe there is an error or problem with your usage of AWS credits, please contact AWS Support at <https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home>.
