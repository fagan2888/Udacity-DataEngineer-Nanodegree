Delete a Redshift Cluster
=========================

Make sure to delete your cluster each time you're finished working to avoid large, unexpected costs. You can always launch a new cluster, so don't leave it running overnight or throughout the week if you don't need to.

1.  On the Clusters page of your Amazon Redshift console, click on the box next to your cluster to select it, and then click on Cluster > Delete cluster.

1.  You can choose No for Create snapshot, check the box that you acknowledge this, and then choose Delete.

1.  Your cluster will change it's status to deleting, and then disappear from your Cluster list once it's finished deleting. You'll no longer be charged for this cluster.
