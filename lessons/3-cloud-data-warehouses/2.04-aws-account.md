Create an AWS Account
=====================

1.  Open a regular AWS account (if you don't already have one) following the instructions via the [Amazon Web Service Help Center](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/)

1.  You will need a promo code from us so you can apply it to your account. To request a promo code, you can submit a support ticket [here](https://udacity.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=110806).

    -   Under the "Reason for Contact" field, choose "3rd Party access, Promo Codes & License keys", then choose "AWS" in the dropdown.

    -   Please note that a regular AWS account will receive a promo code from Udacity with a fixed amount of AWS credits.

1.  To apply your promo code, follow below:
    -   Click "Credits" on the left side of the screen and enter the promo-code you received, then hit "redeem".
    -   Refresh the page and you will be able to view your credits under: Below are all the credits you have redeemed with AWS. Credits will automatically be applied to your bill.
