Launch a Redshift Cluster
=========================

WARNING: The cluster that you are about to launch will be live, and you will be charged the standard Amazon Redshift usage fees for the cluster until you delete it. Make sure to delete your cluster each time you're finished working to avoid large, unexpected costs for yourself. Instructions on deleting your cluster are included on the last page in this lesson. You can always launch a new cluster, so don't leave your Redshift cluster running overnight or throughout the week if you don't need to.

1.  Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon Redshift console at <https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/>.
2.  On the Amazon Redshift Dashboard, choose Launch cluster.

1.  On the Clusters page, look at the cluster that you just launched and review the Cluster Status information. Make sure that the Cluster Status is available and the Database Health is healthy before you try to connect to the database later. You can expect this to take 5-10 minutes.
